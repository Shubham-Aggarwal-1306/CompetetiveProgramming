### Time Complexity:
- Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time taken by an algorithm or code to run as a function of the input size.
- It is independent of the specific machine or hardware used to run the code.
- Time complexity is often represented using Big O notation, which describes the upper bound of the growth rate of an algorithm.
- The article explains the manual counting process for determining time complexity and introduces the three rules for calculating time complexity:
  1. Calculate the time complexity for the worst-case scenario.
  2. Avoid including constant terms.
  3. Avoid lower values.
- The article provides examples and explanations of calculating time complexity for different code snippets.

### Space Complexity:
- Space complexity refers to the amount of memory space required by an algorithm or code to run as a function of the input size.
- It includes both auxiliary space (additional space used to solve a problem) and input space (space used to store the inputs).
- Similar to time complexity, space complexity is represented using Big O notation.
- The article emphasizes the importance of not manipulating given data to reduce space complexity unless explicitly instructed by the interviewer.
- It mentions that companies may use the same data for different purposes, so it's important to avoid manipulating the given data.
